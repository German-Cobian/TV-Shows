# TV-Shows

This website displays TV shows that include the word "comedy in their title. The user can input "likes" as well as comments on the shows of his/her choice.

The comment button brings up a popup window with information regarding the show (title, network, genre, language, rating and a short description of the plot), the comments posted by other users, as well as the form for the current user to input a comment.

The application makes API calls to the [TVMAZE API](https://www.tvmaze.com/api) retrieving information about the movies. Another API, [Involvement API](https://www.notion.so/Involvement-API-869e60b5ad104603aa6db59e08150270), is responsible for saving likes and fetching the number of likes, saving comments and fetching a list of comments. All those functionalities are tied-up in a single codebase.
